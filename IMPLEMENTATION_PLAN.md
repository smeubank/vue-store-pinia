- [‚úÖ] Add Supabase integration to Sentry

**Questions for You:**
1. Do you want to keep the Sentry tunnel endpoint or use direct DSN?
- keep tunnel
2. What's your preferred log level strategy? (debug/info in dev, warn/error in prod?)
- none strictly, just want a good amount of logs, so i can test and demo loggind products across sentry, vercel, supabase, betterstack, and render
3. Should we implement `beforeSendLog` filtering?
- for now no, but i am curious about this feature for later

#### Backend Updates
- [‚úÖ] Update `sentry-sdk` to v2.19.2 with FastAPI integrations
- [‚úÖ] Enable logging integration for Python
- [‚úÖ] Add structured logging for API operations
- [‚úÖ] Add request middleware for comprehensive logging
- [‚úÖ] Remove deprecated `enable_tracing` option
- [‚è≥] Configure tracing for Supabase SDK calls (pending Phase 4)

**Questions for You:**
1. Should we keep the current tracing sample rates (100%)?
- yes
2. Any specific API endpoints that should NOT be traced?
- no

   - i want to store the images in supabase
   - https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/quickstart?queryGroups=language&language=python
   - the pyhton app should fetch them
   - https://supabase.com/docs/reference/python/storage-createbucket 
   - Do you want to demo image transformations? not now

3. **Database**: Do you want to:
   - [yes] Store product catalog in Supabase Postgres
   - [no] Store user cart data (persisted carts) use pinia
   - [not now] Store order history
   - [yes] Demo Row Level Security (RLS) policies?

4. **Edge Functions**: Any specific backend logic to move to Edge Functions?

### Phase 4: Backend Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE (except JWT verification)

#### Supabase Python SDK Integration
- [‚úÖ] Install `supabase-py` package (in requirements.txt)
- [‚úÖ] Configure Supabase client with service role key
- [‚úÖ] Create API endpoints that use Supabase:
  - ‚úÖ `GET /products` - fetches from Supabase DB with fallback
  - ‚úÖ Images served via Supabase Storage public URLs (no proxy needed)
  - ‚è∏Ô∏è `POST /orders` - save order to DB (deferred)
  - ‚è∏Ô∏è `GET /user/profile` - fetch user data (deferred)

#### Authentication Middleware
- [‚è∏Ô∏è] Verify Supabase JWT tokens - **DEFERRED** (no protected endpoints yet)

2. Do you want FastAPI to query Supabase DB directly or use Edge Functions?
3. Any specific business logic to demonstrate?

---

### Phase 5: Database Schema & Migration ‚úÖ TABLES CREATED | ‚è≥ RLS PENDING

#### Proposed Schema
```sql
-- Products table
CREATE TABLE products (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  price numeric(10,2) NOT NULL,
  image_path text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- Orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  total numeric(10,2) NOT NULL,
  status text DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- Order items table
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  order_id uuid REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  product_id uuid REFERENCES products(id),
  quantity integer NOT NULL,
  price_at_purchase numeric(10,2) NOT NULL
);

-- Cart items (optional - for persistent carts)
CREATE TABLE cart_items (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  product_id uuid REFERENCES products(id),
  quantity integer NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, product_id)
);
```

**Status:**
- [‚úÖ] Schema approved
- [‚úÖ] Tables created in Supabase
- [‚úÖ] 8 products seeded with UUIDs
- [‚ùå] RLS policies NOT applied yet (intentionally - testing advisor detection)

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
```sql
-- Example: Users can only see their own orders
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own orders" ON orders
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Example: Products are publicly readable
CREATE POLICY "Products are viewable by everyone" ON products
  FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

**Status:**
- [‚ùå] RLS policies NOT applied yet
- **Testing Strategy**: Intentionally leaving RLS disabled to test Supabase advisor detection
- **TODO**: Apply RLS policies after testing advisor warnings

---

### Phase 6: Storage Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETE

#### Bucket Configuration
- [‚úÖ] Created `api/setup_storage.py` script to automate setup
- [‚úÖ] Created `product-images` bucket in Supabase
- [‚úÖ] Uploaded all product images to bucket
- [‚úÖ] Enabled public access on bucket (not via RLS policy, just bucket setting)
- [N/A] Set up image transformation rules (not needed yet)

**Note on Public Access:**
- Bucket is marked as public in Supabase (bucket-level setting)
- No RLS policies configured on storage yet (storage.objects table)
- Images are accessible via public URLs
- Future: Can add storage RLS policies for more granular control

**Questions:**
1. Should I migrate all images from `/public` to Supabase Storage?
2. Do you want to demo:
   - [ ] Image uploads (user-generated content)?
   - [ ] Image transformations (resize, crop, optimize)?
   - [ ] Signed URLs (temporary access)?

---

### Phase 7: Edge Functions ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Order Creation

**Status:** Implemented for order creation with distributed tracing

**Use Case:** Order processing with distributed tracing demonstration

**Implementation:**
- [‚úÖ] Created `create-order` Edge Function (Deno/TypeScript)
- [‚úÖ] FastAPI calls Edge Function (service-to-service)
- [‚úÖ] Full Sentry integration in Edge Function (separate Sentry project)
- [‚úÖ] Distributed tracing: FastAPI ‚Üí Edge Function ‚Üí Supabase DB
- [‚úÖ] Comprehensive logging and breadcrumbs
- [‚úÖ] Database operations: INSERT orders + order_items
- [‚úÖ] Error handling with transaction rollback

**Key Features:**
- **Separate Sentry Project**: Edge Function has its own Sentry project for monitoring
- **Distributed Tracing**: Sentry trace headers propagated from FastAPI to Edge Function
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Clear transaction boundaries across services
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track Edge Function execution time and DB operations
- **Custom Tags**: Region and execution_id tagged in Sentry

**Technology:**
- Deno runtime (TypeScript first)
- Sentry Deno SDK v9.0.0
- Supabase JS SDK v2
- Deployed to Supabase Edge Runtime

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/functions/create-order/index.ts` - Edge Function code
- `supabase/functions/create-order/deno.json` - Deno configuration
- `EDGE_FUNCTION_SETUP.md` - Complete setup and deployment guide

**API Endpoints:**
- FastAPI: `POST /orders` - Accepts order request, calls Edge Function
- Edge Function: `POST /create-order` - Saves to database

**Other Potential Use Cases (Future):**
- Product Recommendations (personalized)
- Webhook handlers (Stripe, GitHub)
- Image processing/validation
- Real-time inventory updates
