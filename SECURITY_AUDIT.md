# Security Audit & Pre-Commit Checklist

**Status: ‚úÖ Safe for public demo repository**

---

## üîì Public Values (Safe to Expose)

### Sentry DSNs ‚úÖ
**Safe:** Sentry DSNs are designed for client-side use and contain only public keys.
- ‚úÖ `src/main.js` - Frontend DSN
- ‚úÖ `api/main.py` - Backend DSN  
- ‚úÖ `supabase/functions/create-order/index.ts` - Edge Function DSN

**Action:** None - these are meant to be public.

---

### Supabase Anon Key & URL ‚úÖ
**Safe:** These are public by design and exposed in browser network requests.
- ‚úÖ `src/main.js` - Supabase URL and anon key with fallback values

**Why it's safe:**
- Anon key is specifically designed for client-side use
- URL is a public identifier
- Data is protected by **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies, not key secrecy
- Standard practice in all Supabase applications

**From Supabase docs:**
> "The anon key is safe to use in a browser if you have Row Level Security enabled."

**Action:** None - this is how Supabase is designed to work.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTUAL SECURITY CONCERN: Missing RLS

### Current Status:
```markdown
Phase 5: Database Schema & Migration
- [‚úÖ] Tables created: products, orders, order_items
- [‚ùå] RLS policies NOT applied yet (intentionally testing Supabase security advisor)
```

### Risk Level: üî¥ HIGH (for production)
**Without RLS enabled, anyone with the anon key can:**
- Read all data from `products`, `orders`, `order_items` tables
- Modify/delete any records
- Insert malicious data
- Scrape the entire database

### For This Demo: ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPTABLE
This is a **demo repository** with:
- No real customer data
- Intentionally testing Supabase security advisor
- Public dataset (pineapple products)

### For Production: üö® REQUIRED
RLS **must** be enabled before using with real data.

**Example RLS policies needed:**
```sql
-- Products: Public read, service role only write
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read products" ON products FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Service role can modify" ON products FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Orders: Users see only their own
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users read own orders" ON orders FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users create own orders" ON orders FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Order items: Inherit from orders
ALTER TABLE order_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users read own order items" ON order_items FOR SELECT 
  USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.id = order_items.order_id AND orders.user_id = auth.uid()));
```

## üîí Service Role Key

### Location: `api/.env` (gitignored) ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ Properly secured
- NOT in code
- NOT in documentation
- In `.gitignore`
- Set via environment variables

**This is the actual secret** - full database access, must never be exposed.

---

## üìã Repository Status

### ‚úÖ Safe to Make Public:
- [x] Sentry DSNs in code (public by design)
- [x] Supabase URL in code (public identifier)
- [x] Supabase anon key in code (public, protected by RLS)
- [x] Documentation cleaned (placeholders used)
- [x] Service role key properly secured (env vars only)
- [x] `.env` files in `.gitignore`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Production Use:
- [ ] Enable RLS on all tables
- [ ] Test RLS policies thoroughly
- [ ] Set up proper authentication flow
- [ ] Review Supabase security advisor recommendations

## üåê Environment Variables for Deployment

These are **configuration**, not secrets (except service role key):

### Vercel (Frontend):
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co         # Public
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...                          # Public
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com             # Public
PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://key@o673219.ingest.us.sentry.io # Public
```

### Render (Backend):
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co              # Public
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGci...                      # üî¥ SECRET!
SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND=https://key@o673219.ingest.us.sentry.io # Public
```

### Supabase Edge Functions:
```bash
# Set via CLI or dashboard
supabase secrets set SENTRY_DSN_EDGE_FUNCTION=https://key@... # Public
```

**Note:** Only `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is truly sensitive.

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Anon key ‚â† Secret** - It's public and designed for browsers
2. **RLS = Real Security** - Protect data with policies, not key hiding
3. **Service Role = Secret** - This one must never be exposed
4. **This Demo is Safe** - No real user data, intentionally testing features

**‚úÖ Repository is safe to make public as a demo/learning project.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Add RLS before using with real customer data.**
